# MCP Components - Who Is Who?

Let me clarify the terminology because this is a common source of confusion!

## 📋 The Files We Created

| File | What It Actually Is | Role in MCP |
|------|-------------------|-------------|
| `server.py` | **MCP Server** | Provides tools and responds to requests |
| `client.py` | **MCP Client** | Discovers and uses tools from MCP servers |

## 🔍 Detailed Breakdown

### `server.py` = **MCP Server**

```python
server = Server("my-first-server")  # This IS the MCP Server
```

**What it does:**

- ✅ Provides tools (`say_hello`, `get_time`)
- ✅ Responds to `ListToolsRequest`
- ✅ Executes tools when called via `CallToolRequest`
- ✅ This is the "MCP Server" box from our diagrams

**Think of it as:** A specialized service provider (like the GitHub service in our diagrams)

### `client.py` = **MCP Client**

```python
async with ClientSession(read, write) as session:  # This IS the MCP Client
```

**What it does:**

- ✅ Connects to MCP Servers
- ✅ Sends `ListToolsRequest` to discover tools
- ✅ Sends `CallToolRequest` to use tools
- ✅ This is the "MCP Client" box from our diagrams

**Think of it as:** The part that talks to service providers on behalf of applications

## 🎭 Common Confusion: "Our Server"

In the original diagrams, there was a box labeled "Our Server" - this was referring to **your main application** (like a web app or AI application), not an MCP component.

In our simple example:

- We don't have a separate "main application"
- Our `client.py` is acting as both the "main application" AND the "MCP Client"

## 🔄 Real-World vs Our Example

### In Production Applications

```markdown
[Your Web App] ←→ [MCP Client] ←→ [MCP Server] ←→ [External Service]
     │                │              │                │
   Main App        Translator    Service Provider   Real Service
```

### In Our Example

```markdown
[client.py] ←→ [server.py]
     │              │
MCP Client    MCP Server
(+ demo app)  (provides tools)
```

## 🎯 Key Takeaway

- **`server.py`** = The thing that HAS the tools (MCP Server)
- **`client.py`** = The thing that USES the tools (MCP Client)

The naming can be confusing because:

- `server.py` is called "server" but it's specifically an **MCP Server**
- `client.py` is the **MCP Client** that connects to MCP Servers
